<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent    ">"Nora, I've only a few minutes in Chicago. I  must catch the 11:09 back to Richmond. It's after ten now. My cab's at the door. This is what I've come for. I want you to go to-morrow, on as early a train as you can get, to a little hunting-lodge of mine in the Wisconsin woods. Holmes [his valet] will come and take you, and I want you to stay there for a week or ten days."</p><p>The oddness of his request naturally puzzled me, and of course I exclaimed about it, and wanted to know why he wished me to go there. He said irritably:</p><p>"What does it matter why? I want you to go. I insist upon it, in fact."</p><p>"But what will I do up there?" I asked.</p><p>"Anything you wish. Write, if you like. I've a man and woman there. You'll not be entirely alone. The change will do you good."</p><p>"Aren't you going to be there, too?"</p><p>"I'm afraid not. I'll try to get there for the weekend if I possibly can."</p><p>"But I don't want to go to a place all alone, Roger."</p><p>"I tell you, you won't be alone. I have a man and a woman there, and Holmes will take you."</p></div> </div>
