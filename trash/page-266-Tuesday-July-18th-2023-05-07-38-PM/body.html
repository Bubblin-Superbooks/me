"I did not see the doctor myself, but a friend arranged the matter for me. By the way, he owes you a considerable little sum over the amount he paid for your fare from Boston, though we are not going to bother collecting it. We'll let it go."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"It seems he considered the dog a very expensive article. I paid him three hundred dollars for Verley, whose high-bred ancestry I very much doubt."</p><p>"Three hundred dollars! Oh, what a shame! He wasn't worth anything like that," I cried.</p></div> </div>
