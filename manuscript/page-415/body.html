That was my first acquaintance with Kipling. It was an unforgettable experience. In these rooms, too, Bennet read me  "Undine," some of Barrie's stories, and Omar Khayyam.</p><p>Those were clean, inspiring days. They almost compensated for everything else that was sad and ugly in my life. For sad and ugly things were happening to me every day, and I had had no word, no single sign, from Mr. Hamilton.

I could do it, too, when Bennet read to me from the poets; but, ah, at night, that was when he slipped back insidiously upon me! Sometimes I felt that if I did not see him soon, I should go mad just from longing and desire to see his dear face and hear the sound of his cruel voice.</p></div> </div>
