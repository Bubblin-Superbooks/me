Acted just like a man with a sore tooth. Ever seen a man with a sore tooth, Miss Ascough?”</p><p>No, I had never had that pleasure, I told him.</p><p>“Well,” said Hermann, “the man with a sore tooth groans all day and night, and makes every one about him suffer. Then first thing in the A.M. he hikes off to the nearest dentist. He gives one look at the sign on the dentist’s door, and that’s enough for him: he’s cured. Christian Science, you see. Now, that’s how it is with O’Brien to-night. He was dead stuck on coming along, but got stage-fright when he saw the girls.”</p><p>“<em>You</em> weren’t afraid of us, were you, Mr. Hermann?” said I, admiringly and flatteringly.</p></div> </div>
