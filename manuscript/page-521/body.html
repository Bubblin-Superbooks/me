Here's a note for you."</p><p>With hands trembling with excitement, I read Roger's first letter to me. It was like him, those two brief, laconic sentences:</p><blockquote><p>Back by noon. Stay in bed.
Roger.</p></blockquote><p>Stay in bed! I never felt better in my life. I had my stew, and then I went up-stairs and finished copying my novel.</p></div> </div>
