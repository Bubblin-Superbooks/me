<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"What did you do to Bennet?"</p><p>I felt like an overtaken criminal. I could not say a word. I could not look at the face of Bennet's friend. He said:</p><p>"Bob had a dinner engagement with me at a friend's house last night. He didn't turn up. I feared something was wrong. In fact, I've feared for Bob ever since he became infatuated with you." Butler did not mince his words; he just stabbed me with them. "He has been walking about the city like a madman all night long. What did you do to him?"</p><p>"Oh, George," I said falteringly, "I had to break it off."</p><p>As if distinctly to cut me for calling him "George" (I had always called him that), he addressed me as "Miss Ascough."</p><p>"Miss Ascough, were you ever really engaged to Bennet?"</p></div> </div>
