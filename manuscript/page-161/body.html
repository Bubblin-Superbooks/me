She showed me her ring. I envied her not so much for the ring as for the man. I should have loved to be engaged. She said if it wasn’t for the fact that her “fellow” called every evening, she’d take me out with her that night; and perhaps if Albert didn’t object too much, she would, anyhow.

He got twelve dollars a week; but Estelle planned that if they married, Albert, who was the next in line, would take her place. He was bound to rise steadily in the firm, according to Estelle. As they did not intend to marry for two or three years, she expected to have considerable saved by then, especially as Albert was also saving. I liked Estelle from the first, and she liked me. I always got on well with her, though she used to look at me suspiciously whenever she took a piece of gum from the back of the bureau, as if she wondered whether I had been at work upon it in her absence.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line   ">I don’t know how I found my way about the city</p></div> </div>
