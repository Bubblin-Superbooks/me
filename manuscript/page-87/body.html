Again he put his arm about me, and this time I had to struggle considerably to release myself. When he let me go, he said almost testily:</p><p>"Don't make such a fuss. I'm not going to force you," and then after a moment, "By the way, why do you object to being kissed?" just as if it were unusual for a girl to object to that.</p><p>"I'll tell you why," I said tremulously, for it is impossible for a young girl to be unmoved when a man tries to kiss her, "because I want to be in love with the first man who kisses me."</p><p>"And you cannot care for me?"</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Because you are an old man," I blurted out.</p></div> </div>
