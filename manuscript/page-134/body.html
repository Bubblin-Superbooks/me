Mr. Hamilton made me tell him all over again, and in minute detail, just what happened, and when I told him how I cried the rest of the night in ‘Mandy’s arms, he said:</p><p>“Yes, I can see you did,” which made me say quickly, I was so anxious to look my best before him:</p><p>“I look a fright, I know.”</p><p>Whereupon he slowly looked at me and said, with a suggestion of a smile:</p><p>“You look pretty good to me,” and that compensated for everything.</p><p>He gave me the hundred dollars while we were in the dining-room, and advised me, with a slight smile, to hide it in “the usual place.”</p><p>I asked innocently where that was.</p><p>“No one told you <em>that</em> yet?” he asked teasingly, and when I shook my head, he laughed and said:</p><p>“What a baby you are! Why, put it in your stocking, child.”</p></div> </div>
