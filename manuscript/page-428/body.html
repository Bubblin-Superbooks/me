<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">sake! let poor Bennet alone; though if I were you, it wouldn't take me long to know which of those two men to choose between."</p><p>"You'd take Bennet, wouldn't you?" I asked heavily, and she replied:</p><p>"You better believe I would!"</p><p>"Don't you like Mr. Hamilton?" I asked wistfully.</p><p>"I don't entirely trust him," said she. "Candidly, Nora, that was a nasty trick he tried to play us here. I was 'on to him,' but I didn't know just where you stood with him, and I'm not in the preaching business. I let people do as they like, and I myself do what I please; and then, of course, Lord knows I need all the money I can get." She sighed. Poor woman, she was always so hard up! "So if he wanted to take those rooms and pay the price, I wasn't going to be the one to stand in the way. Still, I was not going to let him pull the wool over your eyes, poor kiddy."</p></div> </div>
