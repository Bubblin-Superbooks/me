A face came against my own, and lips were pressed hard upon mine.</p><p>I screamed like one gone mad. I fought for my freedom from his arms like a possessed person. Then blindly, with blood and fire before my eyes and burning in my heart, I fled from that terrible chamber. I think I banged both my head and hands against the door, for later I found that my forehead and hands were swollen and bruised. Out into the street I rushed.</p><p>I heard Verley Marchmont call to me. I saw him like a blur rise up in my path, but behind him I fancied was that otherâ€”that great <em>animal</em> who had kissed me.</p><p>On and on I ran, my first impulse being to escape from something dreadful that was pursuing me. I remember I had both my hands over my mouth. I felt that it was unclean, and that rivers and rivers could not wash away that stain that was on me.</p></div> </div>
