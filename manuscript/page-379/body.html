<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Your friend, Lolly, is right about men, and I'm not different from other men as far as women are concerned; but in your case I am. My desire to do things for you is based on no selfish design. I assure you of that. I simply have an overwhelming desire to take care of you, Nora, to help you."</p><p>I said with as much composure as I could command:</p><p>"Thank you, I don't need help. I'm not so badly off as you think. I make pretty good money, and, anyway, I'm independent, and that's a big thing."</p><p>"But you have to work like a slave. I can't bear to think of that, and as for being independent, you won't be any the less so if you let me do things for you. You may go on with your life in your own way. I'll never interfere or try to dictate to you about anything."</p><p>Almost hysterically I cried out:</p><p>"Oh, please stop talking about this! Every time you come here you scold me about something."</p></div> </div>
