<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent    ">at work in the gallery above. Young Marchmont waited for me outside.</p><p>A quiet had settled down over the place, and for a time I scribbled away upon my pad. I do not know how long I had worked—not more than ten or fifteen minutes—when I felt some one come up behind me, and a voice that I recognized from having heard it often in the House during the session said:</p><p>“May I speak to you a moment, Miss Ascough?”</p><p>I looked up, surprised, but not alarmed. Mr. Burbank was standing by my chair. There was something in his expression that made me move my chair back a little, and I began gathering up my papers rapidly. I said politely, however:</p><p>“Certainly, Mr. Burbank. What can <em>The Lantern</em> do for you?”</p><p>I sat facing the table, but I had moved around so that my shoulder was turned toward him. In the little silence that followed I felt his breath against my ear as he leaned on the table and propped his chin upon his hand, so that his face came fairly close to mine. Before he spoke I had shrunk farther back in my chair.</p></div> </div>
