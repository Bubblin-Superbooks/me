I do not mean so much while I worked for him, but later in my life.</p><p>I have spoken of the mild sensation I made as I walked down that main aisle. All through the day, in whatever direction I looked, I encountered interested eyes bent upon me. Some were those of girls like myself, some office boys, a number of department managers, and nearly all the clerks in my vicinity. Some craned their necks to get a glimpse of me, some came officiously to talk to O’Brien. Thus it was an embarrassing day for me, especially at luncheon-hour, when I did not know quite what to do. Then a girl from another department came over and asked me to go to luncheon with her. She said that her “boss,” whose name was Hermann, and who was a chum of O’Brien, had bade her look out for me.</p><p>She pointed Hermann out to me as we passed along, and he seized his hat, and came after us; but as he was passing our department, O’Brien seized him, and, looking back, I saw them both laughing, and I felt sure O’Brien was telling him about me.</p></div> </div>
