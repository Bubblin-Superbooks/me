I don't know what he said to the woman when she answered the door, but I ran by her and up the stairs to Lolly's room, and I knocked twice before she answered. I heard her moving inside, and then she opened the door and stood there with her blue eyes looking like glass beads, and a cigarette stuck out between her fingers. And I said:</p><p>"O Lolly! <em>Lolly!</em>" She stood aside, and I went in and fell down on my knees by the table, and threw out my arms upon it and my head upon them.</p></div> </div>
