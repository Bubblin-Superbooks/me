In the doctor’s office I found the telephone-book. I looked up the name of Hamilton. Yes, it was there. It seemed to me a miraculous thing that he really was there in that telephone-book and that he actually was in this city.</p><p>I called the number, and somebody, answering, asked whom I wished to speak to, and I said Mr. Roger Avery Hamilton.</p><p>“Who is it wants him?” I was asked.</p><p>“Just a friend,” I replied.</p><p>“You will have to give your name. Mr. Hamilton is in a conference, and if it is not important, he cannot speak to you just now.”</p><p>“It is important,” I said. “He would want to speak to me, I know.”</p><p>There was a long pause, and central asked me if I was through, and I said frantically:</p><p>“No, no; don’t ring off.”</p><p>Then a moment later I heard his voice, and even over the telephone it thrilled me so that I could have wept with relief and joy.</p></div> </div>
