<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent    ">I said thoughtfully:</p><p>“Well, only one or two come to see me, and—no—none of them has yet. I suppose it’s because I’m always so busy; and then I’m not pretty and rich like the other girls here.”</p><p>“You are pretty,” he declared, “and far more interesting than any other girl in the hotel. I think you exceedingly captivating.”</p><p>For that compliment I was truly grateful, and I thanked him for saying it. Then he said:</p><p>“Let me kiss you just once, won’t you?” Again he put his arm about me, and this time I had to struggle considerably to release myself. When he let me go, he said almost testily:</p><p>“Don’t make such a fuss. I’m not going to force you,” and then after a moment, “By the way, why do you object to being kissed?” just as if it were unusual for a girl to object to that.</p><p>“I’ll tell you why,” I said tremulously, for it is impossible for a young girl to be unmoved when a man tries to kiss her, “because I want to be in love with the first man who kisses me.”</p></div> </div>
