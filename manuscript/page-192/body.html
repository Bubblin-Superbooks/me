All the time he was dictating he was chewing tobacco, stopping once in a while to spit in a cuspidor at his feet, and watching my face out of the corner of his eye. This was a sample of the letters I took, and you can judge of my feelings as I wrote:</p><blockquote><p>Messrs. So and So.<br>Gentlemen:<br>I send you F.O.B. five hundred broken babies, three hundred cracked babies, one thousand perfect ones, etc.</p></blockquote><p>Broken babies, cracked babies, perfect ones! What sort of place was this, anyway? The pigs’ hair department was mystifying and horrifying enough, and I <em>had</em> heard that sausages were made from dogs and horses; but a trade in <em>babies</em>—cracked and broken!</p><p>I suppose my face must have betrayed my wonder and perhaps horror, for O’Brien suddenly choked, though I don’t know whether he was laughing or coughing, but he made a great noise. Then he said, clearing his throat:</p><p>“Got all that?”</p><p>I nodded.</p></div> </div>
