<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent    ">At the end of the afternoon session, which was not quite so wearing, as it had grown cooler, I was introduced by Miss Foster to the governor’s secretary, Lord George Fitzpatrick, who had been smiling at me from behind the governor’s back most of the day. By him I was introduced to the governor, who seemed to regard me as a more or less funny curiosity, if I am to judge from his humorous expression. Lord George also introduced me to other government members, and he asked me if I liked candies. I said I did. He asked me if I played golf or rode horseback. I said I didn’t, but I could learn, and he said he was a great teacher.</p><p>By this time I thought I had met every one connected with the House, when suddenly I heard some one—I think it was one of the reporters—call out:</p><p>“Oh, all right, Mr. Burbank. I’ll see to it.”</p><p>Miss Foster was drawing me along toward the door. It was time to go. Our carriage was waiting for us. As we were going out, I asked her whether I had yet met Mr. Burbank, and she said she supposed so.</p><p>“I don’t remember meeting him,” I persisted, “and I want very specially to meet Mr. Burbank.”</p></div> </div>
