<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent    stretch">that afternoon, but I declare that there was not a single newspaper office in Chicago at which I did not call. I went in with high hopes, and I sent in my card to proprietor and editor, and coldly stared out of countenance the precocious office boys, patronizing, pert, pitying, impudent, or indifferent, who in every instance barred my way to the holy of holies within. In not one instance did I see a proprietor of a paper. No deeply impressed editor came rushing forth to bid me enter. In most of the offices I was turned away with the cruel and laconic message of the office boy of “Nothing doing.”</p><p>In two cases “cub” reporters—I suppose they were that, for they looked very little older than the office boys—came out to see me, but although they paid flattering attention to the faltering recitation of my experiences as a reporter in Jamaica, West Indies, they, too, informed me there was “nothing doing,” though they took my address. As far as that goes, so did the office boys. One of the reporters asked me if I’d like to go out to dinner with him some night. I said no; I was not looking for dinners, but for a position.</p></div> </div>
