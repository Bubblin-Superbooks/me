Presently he said:</p><p>“What would you do if I were to take you into my arms by force now?”</p><p>“I would scream,” I said childishly.</p><p>“That wouldn’t do you much good, for I could easily overpower you. You see, there is not a soul anywhere near us here.”</p><p>I experienced a moment’s fear, and stood up, when he said in a kind and humorous way:</p><p class="   squeeze ">“Sit down, child; I’m not going to touch you.

As a matter of fact, I want to be your friend, your very particular friend, and I am not going to jeopardize my chances by doing something that would make you hate me. Do sit down.”</p><p class=" stretch-last-line   ">Then as I obeyed, he asked me to tell him all about myself.
