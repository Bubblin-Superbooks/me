I recognized him, though he was only a silhouette against the light.</p><p>The shock of the awakening, and the horrible realization that he was already crossing the room, held me for a moment spellbound. Then my powers returned to me, and just as I had fled from that negro in Jamaica, so now I ran from this white man.</p><p>My bed was close to the door that opened into the hall. That was pitch-dark, but I ran blindly across it, found ‘Mandy’s door, and by some merciful providence my hand grasped the knob.

I’m afraid to sleep alone,” I said. “Please, please, let me stay with you.”</p><p>“Ah’ll come and sleep on the couch in your room,” she said.</p><p>“No, no, I won’t go back to that room.”</p></div> </div>
