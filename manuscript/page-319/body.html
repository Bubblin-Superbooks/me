Don’t try that on me. I know where you got those clothes. That man Hamilton gave them to you. You didn’t follow my advice, I see.” She shrugged her shoulders. “Of course it’s your own affair, and I’m the last to blame you or any other girl for a thing like that, but, for heaven’s sake, don’t think it necessary to make up fairy-tales to me!”</p><p>“Lolly, I swear to you that I paid for these myself.”</p><p>“Tell it to the marines!” said Lolly.</p><p>“Then see for yourself. Here are the price-tags, and here’s the bill,” I cried excitedly, and I thrust them upon her. Everything came to exactly forty dollars. Lolly looked the bill over carefully; then she put her cigarette in her mouth, and looked at me. All of a sudden she began to laugh. She threw her head back upon the sofa pillows and just laughed and laughed, while I became angrier and angrier with her.
