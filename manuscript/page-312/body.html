I simply have an overwhelming desire to take care of you, Nora, to help you.”</p><p class="   squeeze ">I said with as much composure as I could command:</p><p>“Thank you, I don’t need help. I’m not so badly off as you think. I make pretty good money, and, anyway, I’m independent, and that’s a big thing.”</p><p>“But you have to work like a slave. I can’t bear to think of that, and as for being independent, you won’t be any the less so if you let me do things for you. You may go on with your life in your own way. I’ll never interfere or try to dictate to you about anything.”</p><p>Almost hysterically I cried out:</p><p>“Oh, please stop talking about this! Every time you come here you scold me about something.”</p><p>“Why, Nora,” he said aggrievedly, “I have never asked you to do anything but this. That’s the only thing I ever scolded you about.”</p><p>“Look how you acted that first night, when you saw me with Lolly and Mr. Chambers, and then the night I was up with Fred. You wanted to <em>beat</em> me! I saw it in your face. You could no more help dictating to and scolding me than you can help coming to see me now.”</p></div> </div>
