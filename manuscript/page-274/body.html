Hamilton had called me a wonderful girl, but Fred believed I was an inspired genius. He let me copy all my stories on the type-writer at the office, and would literally steal time for me in which to do it, making Red Top do work I should have done.</p><p>Fred was “in bad” at the yards. It seems that his last “drunk” had completely exasperated certain heads of the firm, and there was a general opinion, so Hermann told me, that Fred’s head might “come off” any day now.</p><p>I was so worried about this that I tried to warn him. He stuck his tongue in one cheek and winked at me. Then he said:</p><p>“Nora, I have an A No. 1 pull with old man Smith, and there ain’t nobody going to get my job here; but I’m working them for the New York job. I want to go east.”</p><p>That made me feel just as badly, for, if Fred was transferred to the New York branch, what would become of me? I could not go, too, and I disliked the thought of working under another.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line   ">I felt so badly about it that I wrote to Mr. Hamilton, who had not been to see me for three weeks.</p></div> </div>
