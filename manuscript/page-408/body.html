<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">little walk along the lake.</p><p>It was a beautiful night, and though only a few weeks from Christmas, not at all cold. Mrs. Kingston had apparently told Mr. Bennet of my writing, for he tried to make me talk about it. I was not, however, in a very communicative mood. I talked disjointedly. I started to tell him about my stories, and then all of a sudden I remembered how I was fixed, and then I couldn't talk at all. In fact, I pitied myself so that I began to cry. It was dark in the street, and I cried silently; so I didn't suppose he noticed me until he stopped short and said:</p><p>"You're in trouble. Can't you tell me what is the matter?"</p><p>"I've got only ten cents in the world," I blurted out.</p><p>"What!"</p><p>"Just ten cents," I said, "and I <em>can't</em> get work."</p><p>"Good heavens!" he exclaimed. "You poor girl!"</p></div> </div>
